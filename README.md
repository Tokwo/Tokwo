# Hiii this is my github profile :3 
I'm a student and most of the things I upload here will be privated or school work. I'm an aspiring programmer and know a good amout of Java. It's the language I have the most experience programming in, but I'm not bad at other common languages like C#, JavaScript, and Python.
